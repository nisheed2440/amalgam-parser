Parser for Amalgam UI to support MPA. 

To be used in conjunction with [Stimulus JS](https://stimulusjs.org/) controllers and [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks).

The parser allows Node JS server to parse templates authored by CMS systems like AEM, XM, Wordpress, Drupal etc. and mount/ hydrate components authored in Angular/ React/ Vue etc. thus allowing for seamless MPA <-> SPA convervsion.

Have a look at the [unit tests](https://github.com/nisheed2440/amalgam-parser/blob/master/src/__tests__/index.ts) to understand how the parser can be used to iterate over a template really quickly. It also gives you a glimse into the helper functions and options that can be provided to the parser.
